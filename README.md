# Greed-Kata

Assumptions made:
- The dice represent a list of unordered integers.
- The game will end whenever the user decideds to quit.

Possible Solutions:
- Overall I stuck to the idea of representing the 5 dice as an array of ints, and built my backend around that idea.

- I played with a couple different ideas of how to visually represent the dice, such as simply with numbers, or through shapes, and ultimately stuck with the idea of drawing shapes to represent each die.
